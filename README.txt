All scripts have been written so that they work correctly when called from the 
project root path, ie. the project folder. Otherwise, the relative path 
settings would be incorrect. 
All the scripts use relative paths so they can be run on another system without 
much effort. In order to run them, python needs to be installed on the system, 
and the path and enviromental variables need to be set so that a call such as 

"python <script_name>"

works. 
The scripts used for an individual experiment are in the results folder, under 
a particular experiment subfolder.
